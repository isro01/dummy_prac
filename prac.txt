Hello World!

This is just for practice of git commands ;)

#1 Creating a Repo:

->Click on new repo and give a name to your repo. Make it public or private as per your wish. Initialise it with
  README.md and add 'gitignore (to ignore certain type of files in a commit) and License.
->Open Terminal and make a new dir and create a text file (just an example).
->Do "git init" in this dir.
->Then add the origin "git remote add origin (link of your repo on github)"
->Then to extract the README.md in your dir do "git pull origin master"
->Now add the files you want to commit "git add file name"
->To push the commit do "git push origin master" NOTE: This pushes the changes(commit) to the master branch. (More on this later)

#  Generating a pull request:

->Firstly do a "git pull origin master" to get the latest changes.
->Then create a new branch to work in. (see the commands list)
->Inside the branch do the required changes.
->Do "git add ." and "git commit -m "___" ".
->Now without switching branches do "git push origin (name of your new branch)".
->Now go to github and you'll see a button saying generate a new pull request. Click on it and write a description(optional)
  to generate a pull request which can be reviewd by your peers and finally merged into master branch.
