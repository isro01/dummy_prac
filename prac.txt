Hello World!

This is just for practice of git commands ;)

#1 Creating a Repo:

->Click on new repo and give a name to your repo. Make it public or private as per your wish. Initialise it with
  README.md and add 'gitignore (to ignore certain type of files in a commit) and License.
->Open Terminal and make a new dir and create a text file (just an example).
->Do "git init" in this dir.
->Then add the origin "git remote add origin (link of your repo on github)"
->Then to extract the README.md in your dir do "git pull origin master"
->Now add the files you want to commit "git add file name"
->To push the commit do "git push origin master" NOTE: This pushes the changes(commit) to the master branch. (More on this later)

#2 Working with SSH

->First check for existing SSH keys on your computer using "ls -al ~/.ssh". File names of public keys are one of the following:
  id_rsa.pub
  id_ecdsa.pub
  id_ed25519.pub
->Generate new SSH key "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C {your_email@example.com}". (Use email account associated with GiHub).
  Default file to store the keys is /home/you/.ssh/id_rsa
->Add SSH key to ssh-agent (So you don't have to type passphrase everytime)
  $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa (or whatever the name of your key file is)
->Add SSH jey to your github account 
  sudo apt-get install xclip
  xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (will add the content in id_rsa.pub to your clipboard)
  Now go to your Github account ->Settings->Add SSH key and paste your key there
->Test your SSH connection by writing "ssh -T git@github.com"
