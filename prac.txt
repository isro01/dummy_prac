Hello World!

This is just for practice of git commands ;)

#1 Creating a Repo:

->Click on new repo and give a name to your repo. Make it public or private as per your wish. Initialise it with
  README.md and add 'gitignore (to ignore certain type of files in a commit) and License.
->Open Terminal and make a new dir and create a text file (just an example).
->Do "git init" in this dir.
->Then add the origin "git remote add origin (link of your repo on github)"
->Then to extract the README.md in your dir do "git pull origin master"
->Now add the files you want to commit "git add file name"
->To push the commit do "git push origin master" NOTE: This pushes the changes(commit) to the master branch. (More on this later)
