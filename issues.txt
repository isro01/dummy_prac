ISSUES AND EXPERIMENTING (We encourage you to try out these on your own)

#1 Working on same files at the same time

#2 Working on different files at the same time - 

No merge conflict is seen in the github repo when working on different files at the same time

#3 Say for example you have a branch with some file A and you checkout a new branch from the 
   current branch. Now in the new branch you add a new file and in the previous branch you make
   changes in the fila A. Here no merge conflict is faced when we try to pull the say new branch
   into the old branch in local.
